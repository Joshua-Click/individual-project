### Project goals

- Use 3 similar cleaned datasets to find the features that best predict diabetes in patients. 


### Project description

- I've taken 3 datasets from kaggle that were cleaned for modeling to determine diabetic patients.  

### The Plan 

### Initial hypotheses

- The dataset with 50/50 Non Diabetic/Diabetic patients will perform the best on modelsets
- What features will have the greatest weight on determining diabetic patients?
- Using the encoded target variable is_diabetic, how will each set perform on models and will this effect how future questionaires should be formatted?

### Acquire: 
- Acquire the data kaggle as 3 separate csv's
- 

### Explore: 
- 
- 
- 
- 

### Modeling: 
- Use drivers in explore to build predictive models of different types
- Evaluate models on train and validate data
- Select the best model based on accuracy
- Evaluate the test data
